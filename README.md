# CPU Scheduling Simulation

This repository hosts a CPU Scheduling Simulation tool designed to demonstrate and analyze various CPU scheduling algorithms. The simulation offers an interactive way to understand how different scheduling strategies work in operating systems.

## About the Project

CPU scheduling is a fundamental aspect of operating systems, responsible for determining which processes run at any given time. This project simulates the behavior of various CPU scheduling algorithms, providing insights into their mechanics and efficiency.

## Supported Scheduling Algorithms

This simulation includes the following CPU scheduling algorithms:

- First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)
- Shortest Job First (SJF)
- Priority Scheduling
- Round Robin (RR)
- Shortest Remaining Time first(SRTF)
